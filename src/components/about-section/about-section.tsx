        When I was in grade 10 I took a stab at my high school's Intro to
        Computer Science course and now flash forward a{" "}
        <i className="text-green-400">(bit more than a couple)</i> years, I have
        had the amazing opportunity to build software for a vast amount of
        clients spanning many different industries.
        <br />
        <br />I am a dynamic and innovative front-end developer with{" "}
        <span className="text-green-400 font-semibold">4+ years</span> of
        experience crafting{" "}
        <span className="text-green-400 font-semibold">responsive</span>,{" "}
        <span className="text-green-400 font-semibold">accessible</span>, and{" "}
        <span className="text-green-400 font-semibold">pixel-perfect</span>{" "}
        user-centric web applications that have been used by millions of people
        worldwide. In working and contributing to all aspects of the software
        development cycle in my day-to-day, I take pride in the top-notch
        quality work I deliver for my clients, and the environment I help to
        foster for my colleagues.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="block h-[1px] bg-green-400 w-full"></span>
        <br />I work primarily as a{" "}
        <span className="text-green-400 font-semibold">React developer</span>,
        and am adept in a variety of modern{" "}
        <span className="text-green-400 font-semibold">tech stacks</span> and{" "}
        <span className="text-green-400 font-semibold">frameworks</span>. I am
        eager to push the boundaries of my own personal growth and expand my
        skill set to adapt to the ever-changing landscape that is web
        development.

        <br />
        Outside of work, I love to explore my other creative outlets such as
        knitting and sewing, playing around with my DJ decks, and curating{" "}
        <i className="text-green-400">almost-too-niche</i> playlists for any and
        every type of occasion. I also love to spend time outdoors - camping in
        the summer, running (when itâ€™s not -20 degrees), and playing ultimate
        frisbee.
        <br />
        <br />
        And a couple more fun facts for the road - I speak French and I've
        planted over 150,000 trees throughout Canada (ask me more about this!)
